Please fill in this template for your PPv2 payment method.
- Define the shortcut {payment-method-name} as the PM you're describing.
- Insert unique anchors.
- {transaction-type} and {currency} serve as placeholders in this document. Please replace with transaction-type and currency that applies to this payment method. 
- Check all links.
- Style Guide: currently work in progress. Therefore, please ensure consistency within the page you're working on.
- A few rules of thumb:
    * Use short, focused paragraphs: State your point in the first sentence of each paragraph and stick with one idea per paragraph.
    * Use notes and tips: Break these out of the main paragraph, which should focus on your key point.
    * Use plain language: Use simple sentences and short words. Use keywords that users use and can relate to. For example, they want to “download,” not to “experience the latest innovations.” Also avoid technical terms and jargon that users may not understand and wouldn’t search for.
- IMPORTANT: PPv2 documentation is a step-by-step description. If you need to add additional information not covered in this template, please make sure that it is included at the respective point in the workflow.

[#PPv2_INSERT_ANCHOR]
=== General Information
//make sure that the heading is always part of the document you're working on, and not part of the include file.
//don't include anchors in the include files. Anchors need to be unique, so the same anchor cannot be included in several payment-method files.
include::{root}/include/ppv2-general-information.adoc[]
//the General Information has been split into two parts so that you can adapt the following sentence according to what is required for your payment method.

Below, we provide a sample request/sample requests for the available transaction type/types <<PPv2_INSERT ANCHOR_Samples_debitauth, insert relevant *{transaction-type}* and adapt type/types accordingly>>
, including field lists with short descriptions.

//Make sure to include both parts of the General Information

[#PPv2_INSERT_ANCHOR_Transactions]
=== Transaction Type/ Types {transaction-type}

////
Choose the relevant description for the transaction :
With _{payment-method-name}_ you can use the transaction types <<link, *debit*>> and <<link, *authorization*>>.

A _debit_ charges the specified amount from the account holder’s bank account and marks it for immediate transfer.

An _authorization_ reserves the specified amount from the account holder’s bank account for a later transfer.

[#PPv2_INSERT_ANCHOR_TestCredentials]
=== Test Credentials
//CAUTION: This section may become obsolete in the near future, as test credentials will be included in the sample headers!

//For now, please insert test credentials after transaction types.
//If there are multiple transaction types with different test credentials, make a separate table for each transaction type. Mark the individual sections with: For transaction type/types _{transaction-type}_
//If we have identical samples for *debit* and *authorization*, include the entire workflow only once. See, for example, Paylib and paydirekt.

[#PPv2_INSERT_ANCHOR_Samples]
=== Sample Workflow
====
*For a successful transaction:*

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-
====
We provide JSON examples for each step of this process. You can find them below.

.Request Headers
[cols="20h,80"]
|===
|Authorization
a| Use username and password as given in your {payment-provider-name} contract to _Base64_ encode the authorization.

For example for `user:password` the authorization header is:
[source,subs=attributes+]
----
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==
----
|Content-Type
a|
For _JSON_ requests the content type header is:
[source,subs=attributes+]
----
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
----
|===


[#PPv2_INSERT_ANCHOR_TransactionType_debitauth_Create]
.1. Create a Payment Session (Initial Request)

You can use the following sample for either transaction type. Please enter the desired value (``debit`` or ``authorization``) for ``transaction-type``.

[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
//insert sample here
----

////
Please adapt the following field table:
- Include only fields that are shown in the request.
- Order the fields by the sequence in which they appear in the request.
- Use only datatypes as indicated in the merging table. See: "templates > fields > datatypes.adoc".
- Check cardinality and size.
- Adapt description. Please give preference to PP v2 descriptions, if available.
Please expand the table as is needed. If possible, please add fields also to this template to make life easier for the other writers.
