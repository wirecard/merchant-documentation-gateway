[#PPv2_paybox_General]
=== General Information

This is a reference page for _paybox_. Here you find all the
information necessary for integrating this payment method into
your Hosted and Embedded Payment Page.

.Are you unfamiliar with {payment-page-v2} ({payment-page-v2-abbr})?

NOTE: Visit one of the integration guides
(<<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP_Integration, Hosted>>,
<<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP_Integration, Embedded>>) for a quick explanation and
a step-by-step guide before continuing.

All <<PPv2, {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> integrations share a
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_Workflow, common process flow>> for creating payments.

Below, you find an example request for the available transaction types
_purchase_ and _authorization_, including field lists with short descriptions.

NOTE: You need to complete these requests with your production credentials.
You receive your credentials with your {payment-provider-name} contract. If you
need your production credentials, contact <<ContactUs, merchant support>>.

|===
|Testing _paybox_

_paybox_ does not offer a payment testing sandbox.
You need to test transactions with your production credentials.

For more details on the ``redirect-url``, see the 
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> 
section.

[#PPv2_paybox_About]
=== About _paybox_

_paybox_ is an Austrian mobile payment provider for mobile payments in Austria.
Consumers with a bank account in Austria, Switzerland or the European

[#PPv2_paybox_Countries]
=== Countries and Currencies

_paybox_ can be used by consumers with a bank account
in Austria, Switzerland or the European Economic Area and a valid
contract with an Austrian mobile phone provider.

As _paybox_ is an Austrian payment method, the only available payment
currency for consumers is EUR.

Two transaction types are available for _paybox_:

- _purchase_
- <<PPv2_paybox_TransactionType_authorization, _authorization_>>

//-

[#PPv2_paybox_TransactionType_purchase]
=== Transaction Type _purchase_

A purchase transaction immediately transfers the order amount from the
consumer's account to the merchant's account.

For a successful _purchase_ transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial purchase request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide JSON examples for each step of this process. You can find
them below. You need to adapt the field values to your system.

[cols="15e,10,75"]
|===
|Field (JSON) |Data Type |Description

|payment-redirect-url |String |The URL which redirects to the payment
form (hosted by _paybox_). Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===

At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPv2, integration method>>).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as  _failed_, but the ``status description`` indicates it
was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64 encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>>﻿﻿
for more details on redirection targets after payment & transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.

.How to proceed after an authorization

To transfer money, the authorized amount has to be captured. {payment-page-v2-abbr} does
not support capturing. However, you can capture an authorization using
the <<RestApi, REST API>>,

if

- the _authorization_ was successful AND has not yet been captured AND has not
been voided (which can also be done using the <<RestApi, REST API>>).
- you provide the ``parent-transaction-id``: This is the ``transaction-id`` of
the preceding _authorization_. You can gather it from the response to a
successful _authorization_.

//-

Click the REST API <<API_paybox, _paybox_ specification>> for details.

[#PPv2_paybox_TransactionType_refund]
=== Transaction Type _refund_

Basically, _paybox_ with {payment-page-v2-abbr} supports _purchase_ and _authorization_ only.
For refunds, use the <<RestApi, REST API>>.

You must provide the necessary data:

- ``parent-transaction-id``: This is the transaction ID of the preceding
debit. You can gather it from the response to a successful debit.
- ``amount`` (can be either the total amount for refunding the full
amount, or a partial amount for a partial refund).
