{payment-provider-name} ensures that you will stay PSD2 compliant without any additional changes to your existing implementation.

[#ApplePay_Introduction]
=== Introduction

_Apple Pay_ is a mobile wallet. Consumers upload their credit or debit card information into the wallet, then use this mobile wallet on an Apple device in lieu of their card. In-store, the consumer simply taps their device to the _Apple Pay_-enabled POS device. On a website or in-app, the consumer clicks the *Apple Pay* button and confirms the payment with their face or fingerprint on their Mac, iPhone, or iPad.

_Apple Pay_ is a secure and seamless payment method that can be accepted accross all platforms: in-app, in store, and on the web. _Apple Pay_ tokenizes all transactions, resulting in your consumers' information being securely protected end to end. The use of 2-factor identification ensures that this payment method is SCA compliant, resulting in negligible fraud rates and ensuring consumers never face a 3DS challenge. _Apple Pay_ enables frictionless card payments and eliminates the need to manually type card or shipping details, increasing conversion rates.

| Term | Definition

|Apple Merchant ID
|You need an Apple Merchant ID (merchant identifier), which can be generated in the Apple Developer Portal. For details see *Create a merchant identifier* in https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/apple_pay/setting_up_apple_pay_requirements[Setting Up Apple Pay Requirements]. 

|Certificate Signing Request File (CSR)
|Required to create your Payment Processing Certificate and Merchant Identity Certificate.

|Payment Processing Certificate
|A Payment Processing Certificate is a certificate associated with your Apple Merchant ID, used to secure transaction data. _Apple Pay_ servers use the certificate’s public key to encrypt payment data. {payment-provider-name} validates the signature of encrypted _Apple Pay_ data for every transaction. The Payment Processing Certificate expires every 25 months. 

|Merchant Identity Certificate
|To set up _Apple Pay_ on your webpage, you need a Merchant Identity Certificate. A Merchant Identity Certificate is a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate associated with your Apple Merchant ID, used to authenticate your sessions with the _Apple Pay_ servers. The merchant identity certificate is only required for _Apple Pay_ on the web; it is not needed to accept payments in your apps.

|Payment Sheet
|The _Apple Pay_ Payment Sheet is the screen that consumers see when they initiate an _Apple Pay_ payment. It can include the user's name, billing address, shipping address, shipping method, phone number, and email address needed to complete the transaction.

[#Create_Merchant_Identifier]
.Step 1: Create a Merchant Identifier

Best practice is to have your Apple Merchant Identifier ready when signing your Apple Pay contract.

. https://idmsa.apple.com/IDMSWebAuth/signin?appIdKey=891bd3417a7776362562d2197f89480a8547b108fd934911bcbea0110d07f757&path=%2Faccount%2Fresources%2F&rv=1[Sign in to the Apple Developer Portal]. 
. Follow Apple’s instructions to https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devb2e62b839?sub=dev103e030bb[create a Merchant Identifier]. When entering the merchant descriptor and identifier, please be aware of the following:
* The description is for your personal records and can be changed later. Generally, the name of your website/app is a good description.
The identifier cannot be changed later and must be unique across all websites/apps. 
+
NOTE: To ensure a unique Apple Merchant Identifier, we recommend to use: +
*merchant.wirecard.yourcompanyname*. 
+
. Review the settings, then click *Register*.
. Request a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). +
You can either provide your key account manager with your Apple Merchant Identifier or you can contact our mailto:crm@wirecard.com[Customer Relations] and request a CSR file. 
+
NOTE: {payment-provider-name} will provide you with separate CSRs for test and production environments. When moving from test to production environments, just request a new CSR for production from mailto:crm@wirecard.com[Customer Relations] and proceed to Step 2.


[#Create_Payment_Processing_Certificate]
.Step 2: Create a Payment Processing Certificate

Once you receive your {payment-provider-name} CSR file, you are ready to create your Payment Process Certificate.

. https://idmsa.apple.com/IDMSWebAuth/signin?appIdKey=891bd3417a7776362562d2197f89480a8547b108fd934911bcbea0110d07f757&path=%2Faccount%2Fresources%2F&rv=1[Sign in to the Apple Developer Portal]. 
. Follow Apple’s instructions for creating a Payment Processing Certificate, but be aware of the following:
* Use the Merchant Identifier you created at Step 1.
* Skip the step where Apple asks you to create a CSR file.
* When you are prompted to upload a certificate signing request, upload the {payment-provider-name} CSR file you received from the {payment-provider-name} Customer Relations.
. Download and save the Payment Processing Certificate (a file with a ``.cer`` extension).
+
NOTE: Once the Payment Processing Certificate is created, _Apple Pay_ can encrypt your payment requests and {payment-provider-name} can validate the payments. No further steps are required regarding the certificate. +
Payment Processing Certificates expire in 25 months.

//-

[#Enable_ApplePay_Capabilities]
.Step 3: Enable Apple Pay Capabilities

. Follow https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev4cb6dfbdb?sub=dev3f2891710[Apple's instructions] for enabling _Apple Pay_ in your app.

//-

[#Register_Merchant_Domain]
.Step 4: Register a Merchant Domain 

--
NOTE: Only required for enabling _Apple Pay_ on the web.
--

. https://idmsa.apple.com/IDMSWebAuth/signin?appIdKey=891bd3417a7776362562d2197f89480a8547b108fd934911bcbea0110d07f757&path=%2Faccount%2Fresources%2F&rv=1[Sign in to the Apple Developer Portal]. 
. Follow Apple’s instructions to register a merchant domain. Use the Merchant Identifier you created at Step 1.
* When entering your domain names, you must register both top-level (e.g. http://wirecard.com/[{domain}]) and all subdomains where the _Apple Pay_ logo will be displayed (e.g. http://wirecard.com/[{documentation-url}]). +
** You can register multiple domains under the same Merchant ID. This is often necessary if you use different domains in various geographies. +
** Domain registration expires with SSL expiration. 

//-

[#Create_Merchant_Identity_Certificate]
.Step 5: Create a Merchant Identity Certificate 

--
NOTE: Only required for enabling _Apple Pay_ on the web.
--

For every transaction, you need to https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api/requesting_an_apple_pay_payment_session[request an _Apple Pay_ payment session] with your Merchant Identity Certificate. 

To create your certificate:

. https://idmsa.apple.com/IDMSWebAuth/signin?appIdKey=891bd3417a7776362562d2197f89480a8547b108fd934911bcbea0110d07f757&path=%2Faccount%2Fresources%2F&rv=1[Sign in to the Apple Developer Portal]. 
. Follow Apple’s instructions to create a https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev1731126fb[Merchant Identity Certificate]. 
* Use the same Merchant Identifier you created at Step 1.
* You must follow Apple’s instructions to create an Apple CSR file. The CSR file you received from {payment-provider-name} does *not* work for creating your Merchant Identity Certificate.
. Download and save the Merchant Identity Certificate (a file with a ``.cer`` extension). 
+
NOTE: Merchant Identity Certificates expire in 25 months. 

//-

All web pages that incorporate _Apple Pay_ must support TLS 1.2. In addition, _Apple Pay_ must be served over HTTPS.

[#ApplePay_FAQ]
=== Frequently Asked Questions for Apple Pay

[%autowidth, cols="s,,"]
|===
3+s| General

s| Question 2+s| Answer 

|Why accept _Apple Pay_?
2+|Two primary benefits of _Apple Pay_ are speed and security. +
In-store, _Apple Pay_ functions as a NFC-capable credit card, but gets consumers through the checkout more quickly. _Apple Pay_ especially improves the consumer experience online. It can eliminate the need for consumers to create accounts or fill out lengthy forms when making purchases on the web in Safari on their iPhone, iPad, or Mac, thereby eliminating two of the main causes of cart abandonment.

|Is _Apple Pay_ secure?
2+|Tokenization and two-factor authorization, requiring a password or authentication through Face ID or Touch ID, mean _Apple Pay_ is one of the most secure payment methods available. Tokenization means the consumer's payment details are not stored in the Apple Wallet, rather a randomized number (token) is stored instead.
Apple does not store or have access to the original credit, debit, or prepaid card numbers that the consumers use with _Apple Pay_. And when they use _Apple Pay_, Apple does not retain any transaction information that can be tied back to the consumers.

|Are there additional fees to accept _Apple Pay_?
2+|No. _Apple Pay_ is processed at the same rate as the credit or debit card your consumer has in the Apple Wallet.

|Will I be liable for fraud on _Apple Pay_ transactions?
2+|Within stores, _Apple Pay_ transactions are treated in the same way as your current credit, debit, or prepaid card transactions. You'll have the same liability rules applied to _Apple Pay_ transactions.
Within apps and on the web, _Apple Pay_ transactions might be treated more favorably than standard transactions with a plastic card. Liability for transactions might shift to the issuer. +
It is important to note that fraud is rarely an issue with _Apple Pay_. We hear from our partners that chargeback rates for _Apple Pay_ are insignificant.

|Are _Apple Pay_ payments charged as card present or card not present?
2+|Payments made using _Apple Pay_ in stores are card present transactions. Payments made using _Apple Pay_ within apps or on the web are card not present transactions.

|How do I let my consumers know that they can pay with _Apple Pay_?
2+a|. Display the https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208087[payment symbols for your region and the _Apple Pay_ mark] prominently on your point-of-sale terminal to let your consumers know they can use _Apple Pay_ in your store. +

3+s| In-app and on your webpage

s| Question 2+s| Answer

|Will I need an _Apple Pay_ developers account for all countries I process payments in?
2+|One Apple Developer account can be used for all markets, so you will not need separate accounts for different markets. You can also use the same Apple Merchant ID if you wish.

|What do I need to sign up for an Apple Developer account?
2+a|* Enrolling as an individual: +
If you are an individual or sole proprietor/single person business, get started by signing in with your Apple ID with https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915[two-factor authentication] turned on. You will need to provide basic personal information, including your legal name and address.
* Enrolling as an organization: +
If you are enrolling your organization, you will need an Apple ID with https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915[two-factor authentication] turned on, as well as the following to get started: +
. pass:q[<u>A D-U-N-S® Number</u>] - Your organization must have a D-U-N-S Number so that we can verify your organization’s identity and legal entity status. These unique nine-digit numbers are assigned by Dun & Bradstreet and are widely used as standard business identifiers. You can check to see if your organization already has a D-U-N-S Number and request one if necessary. They are free in most jurisdictions. https://developer.apple.com/support/D-U-N-S/[Learn more].
. pass:q[<u>Legal Entity Status</u>] - Your organization must be a legal entity so that it can enter into contracts with Apple. We do not accept DBAs, fictitious businesses, trade names, or branches.
. pass:q[<u>Legal Binding Authority</u>] - As the person enrolling your organization in the Apple Developer Program, you must have the legal authority to bind your organization to legal agreements. You must be the organization’s owner/founder, executive team member, senior project lead, or have legal authority granted to you by a senior employee.
. pass:q[<u>A Website</u>] - Your organization’s website must be publicly available and the domain name must be associated with your organization.

//-

|What country code do I need to set for my ApplePayPaymentRequest?
2+|The country code should be set to Germany (DE) as payments will be processed in Germany. See https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/applepaypaymentrequest/1916117-countrycode[Apple’s Documentation].

|What consumer information can I pull from _Apple Pay_?
2+|Consumer information includes a phone number and billing, shipping, and email addresses. For more details, see https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/pkcontactfield[PKContactField].

|Where does information come from in the payment sheet?
2+|The information comes from Wallet & Apple Pay defaults in *Settings*.

|Is the consumer information that comes from _Apple Pay_ verified by Apple?
2+|Consumer information is shared as-is, and is not verified or standardized by Apple. You need to validate it on your platform and communicate through the _Apple Pay_ API if fields should be corrected.

|What does the _Apple Pay_ payment token contain?
2+|The structure, format, and data included in the PKPaymentToken can be found in the https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/PassKit/Reference/PaymentTokenJSON/PaymentTokenJSON.html[Payment Token Format Reference]. PKPaymentTokens only contain information on processing the payment; the consumer information is included in the https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/pkpayment[PKPayment] object. The PKPayment encapsulates the consumer information and the PKPaymentToken.

|What do I do if {payment-provider-name} is unable to decrypt my payment?
2+|If this were to occur, it might indicate that you need to regenerate your Payment Processing Certificate. Payment Processing Certificates from Apple expire in 18-25 months. Contact {payment-provider-name} support at mailto:support@wirecard.com[support@wirecard.com].

|Are there design guidelines for using _Apple Pay_?
2+|Your use of _Apple Pay_ must adhere to the branding and user interface guidelines described in the https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/Apple-Pay-Identity-Guidelines.pdf[_Apple Pay_ Marketing Guidelines] and https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/apple-pay/overview/introduction/[Human Interface Guidelines].

s| Question 2+s| Answer

|How do I start accepting _Apple Pay_ in my store?
2+|To accept _Apple Pay_ in your store, you need to have a contactless payment-capable point-of-sale terminal. +
If you want to learn about available card schemes for your geography, reach out to our sales team. 

|My Wirecard POS terminal is already NFC/contactless payment capable. Can I accept _Apple Pay_ right away?
2+|If you accept contactless payments today, you’re likely able to accept _Apple Pay_ for those networks without any changes. If you’re not already accepting contactless payments, contact {payment-provider-name} to make sure that your point-of-sale setup can accept _Apple Pay_ and ask us to enable it. To learn more, see our https://support.apple.com/kb/HT205747[_Apple Pay_ merchant checklist].

|When consumers pay with _Apple Pay_, do they need to sign a receipt or enter a PIN?
2+|Generally speaking, no, consumers do not need to enter a PIN or sign a receipt, but when paying in stores with _Apple Pay_ in some countries and regions, https://support.apple.com/kb/ht207435[if the consumer's transaction exceeds a certain amount], they might need to enter their PIN. In some cases, they might need to sign a receipt or use a different payment method.

|How do I process returns with _Apple Pay_?
2+|Use the Device Account Number to find the purchase and process the return, just like you would with a traditional credit, debit, or prepaid card payment. In Japan, you can also use the transaction ID on the receipt to find the purchase and process the return.
To see the last four digits of the Device Account Number, ask the consumer to go to Wallet, tap the card, and tap on the top-right corner of the display.
You can also have the consumer hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near the reader, select the card that they used to make the original payment, and authorize the return with https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208109[Face ID], Touch ID, or a passcode.

|Is there a limit to the transaction amount that consumers can use _Apple Pay_ for in my store?
2+|_Apple Pay_ allows your consumers to make easy and secure contactless payments of any amount. Read about https://support.apple.com/kb/HT207435[transaction limits].
