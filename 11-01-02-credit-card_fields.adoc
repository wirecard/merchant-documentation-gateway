[#CC_Fields]
==== Fields

This is the general field reference for _credit card_ transactions.

====
- Format: XML 
- POST requests and responses

//-
====

We provide the request and the response fields in two separate sections:

- <<CC_Fields_xmlelements_request, _Request_>> contains those fields sent in the request (and usually in the response).
- <<CC_Fields_xmlelements_response, _Response_>> contains those fields sent in the response only.

//-

The fields are ordered hierarchically and in separate tables. ``payment`` is the top parent element and all fields that are part of ``payment`` are listed <<CC_Fields_xmlelements_request_payment, in the ``payment`` table>>. 

Some fields listed in this table are _complex type_ fields, e.g. ``payment.account-holder``. _Complex type_ fields are parents to further fields. We offer separate field tables for all parent elements and their respective fields.

NOTE: The tables are sorted alphabetically. Use *Ctrl + F* if you are looking for a specific field.

For example, ``payment.account-holder`` is a parent of ``address``. Click on the link in the table to view the fields contained in a _complex type_ field.


[#CC_Fields_intro_elements]
===== Field Definitions

Each field table contains the following columns:

- <<CC_Fields_intro_elements_name, Name>>
- <<CC_Fields_intro_elements_cardinality, Cardinality>> (for request elements only)
- <<CC_Fields_intro_elements_dataType, Data Type>>
- <<CC_Fields_intro_elements_Size, Size>> (for request elements only)



//-

IMPORTANT: Field definitions may vary by transaction type. Deviations from standard field definitions are given with the respective transaction type.

[#CC_Fields_intro_elements_name]
====== Name
The field name structure is based on the hierarchical relation between individual elements. +
_Example:_ ``order-items.order-item.article-number`` +

.Structure
[mermaid, CC_Fields_intro_elements_parentchild,svg]
----
graph LR
A(parent-element)-->B
B("child = parent-element")-->C
C(child)
E[order-items.]-->F
F[order-item.]-->G
G[article-number]
class E squared-rect
class F squared-rect
class G squared-rect
----


.XML Structure
[source, xml]
----
<payment>
    <order-items>
        <order-item>
            <article-number> </article-number>
        </order-item>
    </order-items>
</payment>
----

In the example, the parent element is ``order-items``, and its child ``order-item``. +
``order-item`` itself is also a parent element of its child ``article-number``. 
The hierarchies are separated by a dot ``.``

[#CC_Fields_intro_elements_cardinality]
====== Cardinality

_Cardinality_ indicates if the field is necessary for the request to work. A field can be either *mandatory* (M) or *optional* (O).

- If a field is *mandatory,* it must be included in all _credit card_ requests and contain a value. Without this field, _credit card_ requests fail. +
- If a field is *optional,* it can, but does not have to be, included in all _credit card_ requests. Including optional fields can have certain advantages. These are included in the respective field description.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some fields can be mandatory for individual requests, depending on transaction type and payment scenario. We list them as *M/O.* See the field description for more information on the respective field's cardinality.
====

====

*Example*:``merchant-account-id`` is listed as *M/O.*

Some transactions require a ``merchant-account-id``, others a ``merchant-account-resolver-category``. These two fields shall be used complementary, depending on the context which is explained in the description field.

//-

[#CC_Fields_intro_elements_dataType]
====== Data Type

_Data Type_ defines the specific characteristics of the input values that can be used for a field. There are seven data types: _String_, _Boolean_, _Date_, _Timestamp_, _Decimal_, _Number_,  and _Enumeration_.


[cols="20,80"]
|===
|Data Type |Description

|String
|A combination of text and numbers which is arbitrary but finite in size. A subset of _String_ values can be defined according to a pattern value, such as ``api-id``. The pattern is given in the _Description_ column.

|Boolean 
|Has one of two possible values (usually either ``true`` or ``false``).

|Date 
|Value taken from a calendar (e.g. the date of birth). +
Format (according to ISO 8601): ``{date-pattern}`` +
This pattern cannot be customized.

|Timestamp
|A moment in time defined by a system. +
Format (according to ISO 8601): ``{timestamp-pattern}`` +
This pattern cannot be customized.

|Decimal
|A numeric value which has digits before and after the decimal point ``.`` +
Example: the amount of money in a specific currency (e.g. 138.53 EUR).

|Number
|A numeric value that has no decimal places, such as the expiration month of a credit card.

|Enumeration 
|_Enumeration_ is a subset of _String_. _Enumeration_ consists of a list of predefined values, e.g. the severity of a status, which can provide the predefined values ``warning``, ``error`` and ``information``.
|===


[#CC_Fields_intro_elements_Size]
====== Size
_Size_ shows how many characters can be used for this field. We provide the maximum value so you can make sure the whole amount of characters is processed.

In general, the _{payment-gateway}_ allows all characters for each field, depending on the _Data Type_. 

If other rules apply to a field, they are stated in the _Description_ column.

- the consumer (for ``account-holder``). The account holder's address is used as the billing address.
- the consumer's shipping address (for ``shipping``). For 3D Secure 2 transactions it is highly recommended to send ``shipping.address`` data in any case, as a complete set of ``shipping.address`` data reduces the likelihood of a challenge test.

with this credit card. Token data is provided with the
<<CC_Fields_xmlelements_request_cardtoken, card-token>> element.
