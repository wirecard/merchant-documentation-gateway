[#CC_Fields]
==== Fields

[#CC_Fields_intro]
===== Introduction

This table is the general field table for _Credit Card_. It gives a general overview of all the fields involved in _credit card_ transactions.

Some transaction types may require a different field definition. If this is the case, the different definition is given directly with the transaction type.

- _Format:_ XML 
- _POST_ requests and responses

//-

Fields, sent in a request, will usually also be part of the response. There are additional fields that are returned in the response only. These provide, for example, the result of the payment process. +
We provide the request and the response fields in two separate sections:

- <<CC_Fields_xmlelements_request, _Request_>> contains those fields sent in the request (and usually in the response).
- <<CC_Fields_xmlelements_response, _Response_>> contains those fields sent in the response only.

//-

Within _Request_ and _Response_, the fields are sorted by hierarchy.

In each section, the _Request_ section and the _Response_ section, the fields are grouped according to their elements (such as _payment_, _account-holder_, _card_, _shipping_, etc).
Each element is displayed with an own table.


[#CC_Fields_intro_elements]
====== Objects

Each field list has the following columns:

- <<CC_Fields_intro_elements_name, Name>>
- <<CC_Fields_intro_elements_cardinality, Cardinality>> (for _Request_ elements only)
- <<CC_Fields_intro_elements_dataType, Data Type>>
- <<CC_Fields_intro_elements_lengthLength, Length>>

//-

[#CC_Fields_intro_elements_name]
._Name_
_Structure:_ 

image::images/11-01-02-credit-card_fields/parent-child.png[] 

_Example:_ ``order-items.order-item.article-number``

// With the corresponding excerpt of the XSD we can show the structure of the xml elements.

The structure shows a hierarchical relation between the elements. We have a parent element consisting of children. Some children can turn into a parent element and have their own children.

According to the above example we have the parent element ``order-items`` and its child ``order-item``. ``order-item`` itself is also a parent element of its child ``article-number``. 
The hierarchy levels are sparated by a ``.``.

[#CC_Fields_intro_elements_cardinality]
._Cardinality_

_Cardinality_ indicates the functional necessity
of the field for the request/response. A field can be either mandatory (M) or optional (O).

- If a field is _mandatory_, it must be included in the request and contain a value. Without this field, the request will fail. +
- If a field is _optional_, it does not have to be included in the request. Including optional fields nevertheless may have certain advantages. 
Reasons why content should be sent with optional fields can be found at the table's description.

The definition of _Cardinality_ may sometimes lead to an ambiguous interpretation.
Look, for example, at the ``periodic``-element. When you send a request without a recurring intention, the ``periodic``-fields are not necessary. But they are mandatory, when you start a payment process with recurring transactions.

In the tables below we will describe the cardinality considering the technical requirement. We provide suggestions in the description of the tables in which context it makes sense to send a field even though its technical cardinality is _Optional_.

//-

[#CC_Fields_intro_elements_dataType]
._Data Type_

_Data Type_ defines the specific characteristics of the input values that can be used for a field. There are seven data types: _String_, _Boolean_, _Date_, _Timestamp_, _Decimal_, _Number_,  and _Enumeration_.

Fields containing child fields (such as ``order-item.article-number``) provide a link in the parent table which points to the table describing the children.

- String: allows a combination of text and numbers with an arbitrary but finite length. A subset of _String_ values can be defined according to a pattern value, such as a api-id. The pattern will be given in the _Description_ column.
- Boolean: has one of two possible values (usually either true or false).
- Date: is a value taken from a calendar (e.g. the date of birth). It follows the pattern YYYY-MM-DD. This pattern cannot be customized.
- Timestamp: Is a moment in time defined by a system. It follows the pattern yyyyMMddHHmmss. This pattern cannot be customized.
- Decimal: is a numeric value which has digits before the comma and after the comma, such as the amount of money in a specific currency (e.g. 138,53 €).
- Number: is a numeric value that has no digits after the decimal, such as expiration month of a credit card.
- Enumeration: is a list of predefined values, e.g. the severity of a status, which can provide the predefined values _warning_, _error_ and _information_.

[#CC_Fields_intro_elements_length]
._Length_
_Length_ shows how many characters can be used for this field. The value given here is the maximum value merchants can use to make sure the whole amount of characters is processed.

In general, the _{payment-gateway}_ allows all characters for each field, depending on the _Data Type_. 

If other rules apply they will be stated in the column _Description_ with each field.

[#CC_Fields_intro_ComplexType]
====== Parent Elements and its Children
Parent elements (also refered to as _Complex type_) are organised in subordinate tables (such as ``address``). The fields itself are part of the respective parent element table (e.g. ``address`` is a subordinate table of ``account-holder``, which is a subordinate table of ``payment``). The parent element table provides a link to the table of the child element.

``card`` is a child of  <<CC_Fields_xmlelements_request_payment, ``payment``>>. ``card`` details are sent only in the first transaction request when the card is used for the first time. Due to
<<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_Tokenization_Introduction, PCI DSS>> compliance, ``card`` details are immediately replaced by a token. Beginning with the first response, this
token is used for every consecutive transaction (request and response) that is performed
with this credit card. Token data is provided with the

EMV cards are smart
cards (also called chip cards or IC cards) that store their data on integrated
circuits in addition to magnetic stripes (for backward compatibility). These
include cards that must be physically inserted (or "dipped") into a reader, as
well as contactless cards that can be read over a short distance using
near-field communication (NFC) technology. (Taken from Wikipedia)
KKS: OK as an internal reference but in my opinion not needed here. Maybe describe card types separately?

[#CC_Fields_xmlelements_request_cardpin]
.card-pin

``card-pin`` is a child of <<CC_Fields_xmlelements_request_card, ``card``>>. 

A PIN pad or PIN entry
device is an electronic device used in a debit, credit or smart card-based
transaction to accept and encrypt the cardholder's personal identification
number (PIN). PIN pads are normally used with payment terminals, automated
teller machines or integrated point of sale devices in which an electronic
cash register is responsible for taking the sale amount and initiating/handling
the transaction. The PIN pad is required to read the card and allow the PIN to
be securely entered and encrypted before it is sent to the bank.
(Taken from Wikipedia)
KKS: are these fields also required for online transactions, or only POS transactions?

to the billing address held on file by the card issuing bank. If the address
does not match then the transaction can be declined. AVS is an on-demand service
